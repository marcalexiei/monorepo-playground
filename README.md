# Monorepo playground

Childish attempt to setup a decent monorepo.

The main idea is to have a minimal setup with `npm` and `typescript` and `biome`  that can be used a template to try out any tool:

- build
- test
- package managers
- JS runtimes
- ...

## Tools to try out

- [ ] test with `vitest`
- [ ] build system with `vite`
- [ ] add commitlint
- [ ] add formatter
- [ ] add linter

## Features

- ✅ npm workspace support
- ✅ TS support
  - ✅ IntelliSense support!

## Try it out

1. Clone repo
2. Run
  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
